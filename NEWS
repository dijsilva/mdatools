v. 0.3.1
========

* PLS and all related methods were rewritten from the scratch to make them faster, more efficient
and also to follow the same code conventions as previously rewritten PCA. Here are main changes
you need to do in your code if you used mdatools PLS before: `selectNumComp(model, ncomp)` instead
of `pls.selectncomp(model, ncomp)`, `test.x` ad `test.y` instead of `Xt` and `yt`, finally separate logical
arguments `center` and `scale` are used instead of previously used `autoscale`. By default `scale = F` and `center = T`.

Before:
model = pls(xc, yc, ncomp = 5, autoscale = 2, Xt = xt, yt = yt)
model = pls.selectncomp(model, 3)

Now:
model = pls(xc, yc, ncomp = 5, scale = T, test.x = xt, test.y = yt)
model = selectNumComp(model, 3)


* PLS and all related methods are now well documented (see `?pls`)

* plotting tools for all classes and methods were rewritten completely. Now all plotting methods 
use either `mdaplot` or `mdaplotg` functions, which extend basic functionality of R plots. For example, 
they allow to make color groups and colorbar legend, calculate limits automatically depending on 
elements on a plot, make automatic legend and many other things.
